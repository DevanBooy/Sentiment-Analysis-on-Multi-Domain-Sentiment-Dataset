# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Multi-Domain-Sentiment-Dataset

This Capstone Project is about a basic form of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) called Sentiment Analysis. For this task, I was required to use a
recurrent neural networks to try and classify a book review as either positive or negative

This problem can be broken down into the following steps:
1. Get the dataset
2. Preprocess the Data
3. Build the Model
4. Train the model
5. Test the Model
6. Predict something

For this task, I used a small portion of the Multi-Domain Sentiment
Dataset, which contains product reviews from Amazon. The full dataset contains
reviews for products under the categories: kitchen, books, DVDs,and electronics,
but I only be looked at reviews for the book category.
